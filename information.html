          style="color: white;">Today, it is rare to find someone under the age
          of 70 who doesn¡¯t use the Internet ¨C at least occasionally. Regardless
          of your age and your interests, the Internet provides an easily
          accessible source of information and a virtually endless supply of
          entertainment. Importantly, the Internet is no longer tied to a home
          computer and can be accessed almost anywhere via cell phones, laptops,
          tablets, gaming consoles. Wherever you go, the Internet is waiting for
          you.</span></span><br>
      <span class="fs24 ff2 cf0"><span style="color: white;"></span></span><span
        class="fs24 ff2 cf0"><span style="color: white;"><br>
        </span></span><span class="fs24 ff2 cf0"><span style="color: white;">The
          question is, when does normal use cross the line into excessive use or
          addiction? &nbsp;Because Internet Addiction is not a formal diagnosis
          (at least yet), there are no agreed upon standards for what defines
          addictive behavior. The one thing that almost all professionals agree
          upon is that the number of hours spent online is, by itself, not
          enough to indicate a problem. </span></span><br>
      <span class="fs24 ff2 cf0"><span style="color: white;"></span></span><span
        class="fs24 ff2 cf0"><span style="color: white;"><br>
        </span></span><span class="fs24 ff2 cf0"><span style="color: white;">For
          example, one person may spend 40 hours or more per week on the
          Internet because his or her work depends on it. Another person may
          spend 25 hours per week chatting with family members in another
          country. Is this an addiction? Is it excessive? This really depends on
          how the time online is (or isn¡¯t) interfering with other important
          areas of life such as work, school, health, and in-person
          relationships. </span></span><br>
      <span class="fs24 ff2 cf0"><span style="color: white;"></span></span><span
        class="fs24 ff2 cf0"><span style="color: white;"><br>
          Consider two people who both spend 30 hours per week online. Person A
          is not working, has withdrawn from family and friends, and has few
          social interactions beyond meeting people online. Person B also spends
          30 hours per week online but is working, finds time to meet with
          friends a few times per week, and generally has a fulfilling life
          outside of the virtual world. Clearly, Internet use is more of a
          problem for one of these people than the other. Of course, whether
          Person A¡¯s Internet use is a cause or a symptom of other problems is a
          great question and is something that is covered in another section of
          this article. <br>
          <br>
          As a general rule of thumb however, <i>if a person repeated goes
            online to avoid real world responsibilities or difficulties and this
            avoidance creates even more problems in their life, this may suggest
            the presence of an addiction to the Internet<span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span></i></span></span></p>
